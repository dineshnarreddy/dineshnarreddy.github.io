      <h1>Smart farming help, in simple language.</h1>
      <p>
        Our AI assistant uses <strong>weather, soil, sensors and leaf images</strong> to guide
        irrigation, fertilizer and pest control – for open-field mango orchards and tomato
        greenhouses.

    <div class="grid three">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Irrigation</h3>
        <p>
          Tells you <strong>when to water, how much, and for how long</strong> – based on soil
          moisture, crop stage, weather forecast and pump capacity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
        <p>
          Stage-wise nutrition plans that respect local costs and avoid over-use of chemicals,
          with templates for each growth phase.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Pest &amp; Disease</h3>
        <p>
          Weather-based outbreak alerts plus <strong>image-based diagnosis</strong> from leaf photos
          and drone images – more than just a leaf-scanner app.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reduce guesswork</strong> – decisions based on data, not only tradition.</li>
          <li><strong>Save water, energy and fertilizer</strong> – fewer unnecessary irrigations and sprays.</li>
          <li><strong>Protect yield</strong> – early warnings for high disease-risk days.</li>
          <li><strong>Works offline or with weak internet</strong> – runs on a small edge device on the farm.</li>

          The goal is simple: practical AI that small and medium farmers can trust, not a black box.
          Every recommendation comes with a short “<em>why</em>” explanation.

    <h2>Backed by research, built with farmers in mind</h2>
    <p>
      This assistant is part of an ongoing PhD project on
      <strong>AI &amp; IoT for smallholder farmers</strong> at a UK university.
      It combines a systematic literature review, simulation studies and
      <strong>real farm &amp; greenhouse trials</strong> in India and the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision is to keep the core technology <strong>affordable and accessible</strong> for
      small farmers, while also offering advanced features for commercial greenhouses.
